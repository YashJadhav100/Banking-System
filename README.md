# 🏦 Banking System – Java Console Application

This is a simple command-line **Banking System** built in Java that simulates core banking operations such as account creation, balance inquiry, deposits, and withdrawals. It’s designed to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, modular Java structure, and user interaction via console inputs.
